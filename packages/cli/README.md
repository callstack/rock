  ü™® Rock is a modular toolkit for teams building React Native apps. It helps improve build times and developer experience while fitting into your existing workflows and infrastructure.
</p>

---

## Key Features

**‚òÅÔ∏è Remote Build Cache**  
Save up to 96% of build time by reusing native artifacts (APK, AAB, APP, IPA) across machines and CI. Use built‚Äëin integrations for GitHub, S3, and R2 or bring your own storage.

**üîó Brownfield ready**  
Add React Native to existing iOS and Android apps using Rock Brownfield.

**üîå Modular & Extensible**  
A plugin‚Äëdriven architecture that lets you customize platforms, bundlers, cache providers, and more.

**üñ•Ô∏è Cross‚Äëplatform‚Äëready**  
iOS and Android by default; designed to extend to TVs, macOS, and Windows (coming soon).

**‚ö° Easy Community CLI Migration**  
A familiar CLI that helps you develop, run, and build your app. Migrate from Community CLI in minutes.

## Installation

Choose your path based on your current situation:

### Creating a new project

> [!TIP] 
> For **new projects**, we recommend starting with [Expo](https://expo.dev) for the best developer experience and similar remote caching capabilities. Rock is designed for teams who have outgrown the Community CLI.

To create a fresh React Native app with Rock, open a terminal and run:

```shell
npm create rock
```

### Migrating an existing Community CLI project

To migrate an existing project, open a terminal in your project root and run:

```shell
npm create rock
```

### Adding to an existing native project

To add React Native to an existing iOS or Android app with Rock, use our Brownfield plugins:

```shell
npm create rock
# ...
‚óÜ  What plugins do you want to start with?
‚îÇ  ‚óº brownfield-ios
‚îÇ  ‚óº brownfield-android
```
